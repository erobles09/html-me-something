                <p>You know how we all get asked "What do you want to be when you grow up?"?
                    Well, my very first dream was to become a professional boxer. I wanted to be
                    the person my family cheered for in a fight. The person millions around the world 
                    loved to see fight. The first fight I can remember watching was De la Hoya vs. Mayweather.
                    My family was so into the fight. Everyone was cheering and being loud that I felt like thats what
                    they liked. I wanted to be what they liked. I mentioned it to my parents and they completely
                    disagreed. They were not fans of the idea of me getting beat in a ring. Then they told me I already
                    needed glasses I'd end up worse if I boxed. To this day this is my biggest dream, but perhaps in another
                    life it seems.

                <p>So I had to give up on boxing. What would I be now? I went into the fifth grade and I saw our basketball gym.
                    This was it. My next dream. I was in love all over again. So I brought it up to my parents again. They didn't turn it
                    down, but weren't too excited about it either. They also mentioned that they probably wouldn't have time to take me to
                    practice or my games. So I tried it out. Let's just say I wasn't too good at it. My parents bought me a hoop in the 
                    backyard and I practiced and practiced. Didn't see improvement, couldn't get a ride to practice so I ended up just giving up
                    once more.

                <p>Boxing? Nope. Basketball? Definite no. What am I going to be now? I gave up on that thought for the next two years
                    of my life. Here came the start of 7th grade. All of my friends were into soccer. Every last one of them actually.
                    Started to play, watch videos, watch games, and learn about the sport. Tried some positions out and tried to be like
                    my favorite players. Soccer became everything for me and I played every chance I had. I ended up playing in high school,
                    semi pro outdoor and professional indoor. Didn't think I'd make it in the big stage and decided to move on.

                <p>Now I was in my senior year of high school. I get asked the question one last time.
                    "What do you want to do for a living?". This time I was stunned. The question changed.
                    It was no longer "What do you want to be when you grow up?", It changed to "do for a living".
                    Things got real for me quick. I was going to college in a few months and didn't know what I wanted to be.
                    Then I had a premature cousin born. It hit me instantly then. I wanted to be a "neonatalogist". After two premature
                    sisters and one premature cousin this was what interested me the most. Went to college for one year and had a child.
                    I then dropped out to take care of my daughter and her mother.

                <p>After dropping out of college, having a child, and moving out of my parent's house, what was next?
                    I gave up on this idea for the past 3 years. A lot of things came to mind, but nothing caught my attention
                    or I simply didn't have time with my busy work schedule. I've always had a love for tech. Anything that was 
                    changing our daily lives was amazing to me. Then one day, when I was watching a video on youtube, I saw
                    that the guy said he was a dev. It caught my attention and started to research. I found launchcode, enrolled
                    and now I'm here. Hoping that this works out for me and one day I can work for one of my favorite companies
                    and play a huge part in something big in technology.
